Password Generator/Keeper

1. Upon download of all three files (PassGen.py, Passkeep.py and passgen.txt), execute Passgen.py to generate your password table
2. It should automatically be written to the text file(soon to be encrypted)
3. Now execute Passkeep.py and then put in 4 digits to remember then a complex password is output and you can use that for any site. 

**DISCLAIMER** Do not use PassGen.py more than once otherwise you risk overwriting your password table and thus changing your passwords
, possibly losing access to any site or logins prior used. Only to be used initially and if you are wary of a compromise and need to change
passwords ASAP
